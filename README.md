# Movie DB

Model the relationships between Actors and the different roles they have with the movies they work on.

## Scenarios to consider for design.

### An actor can star in many movies; sometimes they can play multiple characters in the same movie (think Eddie Murphy in The Nutty Professor, where he plays 7 characters).
### An actor can direct many movies; they can also star in the movie they're directing (think Ben Affleck in Argo).
### An actor can write the screenplay for many movies, they can also star in the movie they wrote the screenplay for (think Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in Good Will Hunting).

## Implemented solution.
